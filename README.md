# book-recommendation
## Description
The goal of this project is to build a book recommendation engine based on the language used in the book. I have a set of 35000 books from Project Gutenberg (More info on how I got those books can be found in the ```data/``` folder's README. I then sample 5000 words from each book. I get vector representations of each of the words from ```gensim```. I calculate a weighted average of the the 5000 vectors in the document using [tf-idf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) weighting. I can then use this vector representation of the document to compare to other documents or words. Comparisons are made using [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) with higher values denoting greater similarity.
